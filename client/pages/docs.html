                <h2>Configuration</h2>
                <p>The MEAN seed project needs a few configuration options set before it will run. Configuration files are found in the /server/config/ folder.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Environments</strong> (env-config.js) - Like many node.js apps, the project uses an environment variable named `NODE_ENV` to specify the application's run mode. The MEAN Seed uses the typical <em>development</em>, <em>staging</em>, and <em>production</em> environments but you can also add your own.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Specify your desired database and session store connection strings for each environment.</li>
                            <li>Set your app name.</li>
                            <li>Set the web root paths for the client and server app (if you change the default locations).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Email</strong> (email-config.js) - Email is used for new account confirmations and password resets.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Set up your desired email service credentials.</li>
                            <li>Update the email sender, subject, and body text as desired.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Sessions</strong> (express-config.js) - The MEAN Seed uses cookie-based login sessions for authentication. You can set the session cookie name and secret here.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Testing Data</h2>
                <p>To expedite testing, the MEAN Seed includes some test user data that can be populated each time the app loads in the development environment. You can customize this data in the /server/data/dev-data.js file.</p>

                <h2>Start the Dev Environment</h2>
                <p>The MEAN seed application is self-contained. The REST service and the client app are both run from a simple node server. In local development, the node server listens on localhost:9000. To start the application in a local dev environment, simply run the command:</p>
