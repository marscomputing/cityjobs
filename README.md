# REST/MEAN Seed Project

A seed project for building RESTful apps with node, mongo, express, and angular

## Dev Environment
The REST/MEAN seed application is self-contained. The REST service and the client app are both run from a simple node server. In local development, the node server listens on localhost:9000. To start the application in a local dev environment, simply run the command:

    ./startdev.sh

## Credits
The REST/MEAN seed was developed by Filip Adamczyk, Ericson de Jesus, and Phil Puleo.
